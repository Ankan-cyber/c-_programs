# C++ OOP Programs

This repository contains a collection of C++ programs that demonstrate various concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP). Each program is designed to illustrate the use of OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

## Programs

1. **Shape Class** - A program that defines a base `Shape` class and derived classes for different types of shapes (e.g. Circle, Square, Triangle).

2. **Bank Account** - A program that simulates a bank account, with classes for account holders and transactions.

3. **Student Management** - A program that manages a list of students, with classes for students, courses, and grades.

4. **Inheritance** - A program that illustrates how classes can inherit properties and methods from a base class.

5. **Polymorphism** - A program that demonstrates how objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common base class through polymorphism.

6. **Encapsulation** - A program that shows how data can be hidden and protected through encapsulation.

## How to Run

Each program can be compiled and run using a C++ compiler such as g++. For example, to run the Shape Class program, use the following command:

```
g++ shape.cpp -o shape
./shape

```


Make sure to replace "shape.cpp" with the name of the program you want to run.
